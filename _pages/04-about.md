### FAQ

<details>
<summary>Why Economics?</summary>
<br>
I have always wanted to work in an industry that involved studying money. As a child I was so confused why things "back then" cost so little and wondered why we couldn't somehow make a loaf of bread cost $0.25 again. I now know the benefits of targeted low and stable inflation and why deflationary practices would be determental to the economy. I also know I didn't really want to work on "Wall Street", and since most of my immediate family studied social science in college, economics was a fantastic natural fit for me.

<summary>Why Finance?</summary>
<br>
One of my favorite books as a child was "The Motley Fool Investment Guide for Teens". I was so fascinated with the financial concepts of compound growth, retirement matching, and saving for the future. Since learning about personal finance at a young age, I have been very frugal with my spending. I was even hesitant to spend my $25 iTunes gift card birthday presents even though the money could only be spent on iTunes! I used to wonder why stock prices would go up or down at different times until I learend the price only reflects how much the collective is willing to pay for something, using the laws of Supply and Demand.

<summary>Other Interests?</summary>
<br>
I believe the key to a fruitful and long life is through learning. I spend most of my free time listening to podcasts, learning spanish, reading, playing the piano, and learning new computer software and coding. I even taught myself to how to use Markdown, Jekyll, and YAML to get this website up and running! I also rely on a healthy exercise habit of running, stretching, and using gymnastic rings for calesthetics to keep my mind clear and stress free.
