These are just some great financial calculators I tend to reach for.

#### [Income After Taxes Calculator](https://smartasset.com/taxes/paycheck-calculator)

This is a great calculator to estimate how much your paychecks will be and see how much you will earn annually after taxes. I recommend taking an extra ~10% off the website’s estimates since it doesn’t include retirement contributions which are common.

#### [Income Class Calculator](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/07/23/are-you-in-the-american-middle-class/)

This is a great calculator to remind people what income class they fall into. Too many times I’ve heard people say they’re “upper-middle class” when I know they are technically in a “high income” family. This will help clear things up.

#### [Investment Returns Calculator](https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/retirement/investment-goal-calculator.aspx)

I love using an investment calculator to demonstrate the power of compound interest. Play around with the numbers to see what it would take to become a millionaire!

Note: The “Investment taxes and inflation” section’s default numbers help keep a conservative perspective on what your tax rates and inflation will be. You can change these numbers to your liking, but keeping a conservative estimate on investment returns is a smart approach.
