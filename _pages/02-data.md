Welcome to my data section! This is an area dedicated to sharing popular databases available on the internet as well as resources for beginner coders starting to use data science tools for the first time.

### Databases

Here you will find a list of popular databases I frequently share with others along with general popular databases used by most in the industry.
I have them broken out by Government Databases, Non-Government Databases, and Financial Calculators.

[Government Databases](https://andrewaferrante.github.io/data/government-databases/) include a list of primary source databases with data collected by federal, state, and local governments. These are considered gold standard quality data in the industry.

[Non-Government Databases](https://andrewaferrante.github.io/data/non-government-databases/) are databases organized by nonprofits, private companies, or non-government organizations. Some are as widely used as government databases and even use government data themselves.

[Financial Calculators](https://andrewaferrante.github.io/data/financial-calculators/) is not a list of places to find data, but more of a source of helpful calculators you can use for personal finances.

All the resources come from my ever growing list of bookmarked resources, so more will be added as the years go by!

### Beginner Coding

Here you will find my tutorials on starting out as a beginner using popular data science tools. The purpose of the tutorials is to help Excel users easily nagivate the growing world of data science. Sometimes, there are free data tools available that can manipulate data easier than Excel, or even work with data that isn't possible in Excel. I want to help beginners take advantage of what is available.

My mission is to help beginner users learn about these fantastic resourses without having the barriers to study industry **jargon** and to help find the best ways to **troubleshoot**. I had a hard time learning a lot of these tools since there is a lot of jargon to try and understand. Also, when I would get stuck working on certain projects, it became frustrating trying to figure things out, so I want to help beginners find the best way to troubleshoot when they inneviatebly come across problems.
