I am planning on adding some fancy timeline about financial regulation in the United States. Will possibly branch out into the history
of financial regulation in other countries, but for now am focusing on American history.

Things in the works:
* US financial regulation timeline
* Market performance timtline
  * By security type
  * By asset class
* History book recommendations
